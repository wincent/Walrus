Hextrapolate provides two adjustable fields for showing a number in a text encoding of your choice (ASCII, UTF-8 or UTF-16). It is normal for garbage characters to appear in these text fields, depending on the number under conversion.

For example, you might enter a number that corresponds to valid UTF-8 or UTF-16 but your system does not have a font installed that contains the corresponding glyphs. In these cases the system may substitute a meaningless character such as a square or a box.

It is also possible that the textual representation is valid and the corresponding glyphs are available but they are from a foreign alphabet.

The screenshot below demonstrates both of these possibilities.
