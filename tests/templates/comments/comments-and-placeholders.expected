Very similar to the other tests:
  - "comments-and-text.tmpl"
  - "comments-and-directives.tmpl"

Basically, if a comment occupies an entire line then the entire line should be gobbled up.
Not even the trailing newline survives in the output.
That would lead to possibly unwanted empty (zero-width) lines.

When placeholders come into play the rules are much the same:
  - if a comment is appended to a line which produces output, the trialing end-of-line survives
  - this means if a comment appears after an output-producing placeholder, the end-of-line will survive
  - but if it appears after a placeholder that produces no output, the end-of-line dies along with the comment
 
Examples:
 
1. The following line is a comment that occupies an entire line
 There should be no blank line above this line...
 
2. This line has a comment after it...
 
3. And this one has an empty comment after it...
 
4. Items "2" and "3" above should be intact, separated by a blankline

5. Now will include a non-existent placeholder followed by a comment:
There should be no blank above this line...

I just defined a placeholder, but I'll be you didn't even notice...

6. Now an existent but zero-width placeholder followed by a comment:
There should be no blank above this line...

7. Same as last one, but put separate the two with a space
 
The line above should contain a single space.

8. One more test: a proper placeholder
placeholder... 
The line above should read "placeholder... "
