This is a test 
in which comments will be intermingled with directives...


Here's an example. This line should be immediately followed by another line.
Here is the other line.

But in this example, there should be a line containing only a space after this one.
 
Note the line above which contains only a space.

We can do the same kind of demonstration with directives...
(and placeholders, but that will be a task for another test file)

Basically if a directive produces no output...
any comment that follows it...
will be treated as if it occupied the whole line...
That means the trailing end-of-line will get thrown out as well...

Example: the next line contains a directive that produces no output...
That line should have been gobbled up in the final output.
