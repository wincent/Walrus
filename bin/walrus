If you are trying to run Walrus but have not yet installed it, it may be that
Ruby cannot find the Walrus files. You can help Ruby to find the Walrus "lib"
and "ext" directories by adding them to the RUBYLIB environment variable. For
example, you could do the following if you are using the Bash shell,
substituting absolute paths for "lib" and "ext":

  export RUBYLIB="${RUBYLIB}:lib:ext"

    HERE
    exit EXIT_LOAD_ERROR
  end
  
  begin  
    Runner.new.run
  rescue Runner::ArgumentError => e
    $stderr.puts "Error: #{e.to_s}", "For usage information type: #{$0} --help"
    exit EXIT_ARGUMENT_ERROR
  rescue Runner::Error => e
    $stderr.puts "Error: #{e.to_s}"
    exit EXIT_OTHER_ERROR
  end
  
end # module Walrus
