= 0.5: not yet released

* if a list of Ruby expressions is supplied to the +#echo+ directive, all are
  evaluated, but only the last one is emitted to the template; this brings
  Walrus in line with most other template systems' behavior
* the +--debug+ switch, which never actually did anything, has been removed
* added a +--recurse+ switch; this is a long form of the existing +-R+ switch
* fixed a "stack level too deep" error when passing directories to the
  +walrus+ tool
* passing directories to the +walrus+ tool now works more usefully, only
  selecting files matching the +--input-extension+ rather than expecting every
  file in the directory to be a template
* the grammar no longer includes the archaic vertical tab in its definition of
  "whitespace"
* Wopen3 has been made a development dependency instead of a runtime one,
  which means that the Walrus codebase is now fork-free and should be more
  compatible with JRuby (previously the forking meant that compiling worked to
  an extent under JRuby but filling did not work at all); more compatibility
  work is still to be done
* +walrus fill+ and +walrus run+ no longer spawn a separate Ruby process in
  order to capture the output of each template, insteading evaluating the
  templates in the context of the existing Ruby process, which is more
  efficient
* various optimizations for speed and memory use
* more work on compatibility with Ruby 1.9

= 0.4: 23 August 2010

* the +-R+ (recurse) option for the +walrus+ command-line tool now defaults to
  true, bringing the implementation in line with what the usage text always
  claimed
* the default output extension is now the empty string, meaning that the
  suggested workflow is to name your templates like +template.html.tmpl+
  (which would compile to +template.html.rb+ and produce +template.html+ when
  filled)
