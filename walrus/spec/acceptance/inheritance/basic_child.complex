#extends 'basic_parent'
#def footer
This is the overridden footer. Note that in the overridden version of the footer
I'm using a \#def block rather than a \#block like in the parent template. The
reason for this is that \#block calls automatically in-line their contents at
the point where they are declared.

Given that this template \#extends the parent, the parent will *already* be
in-lining the footer, so there is no need to in-line it again.
